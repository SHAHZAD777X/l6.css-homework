<p>Outer space, or simply space, is the expanse that exists beyond Earth's atmosphere and between celestial bodies.[1] It
contains ultra-low levels of particle densities, constituting a near-perfect vacuum[2] of predominantly hydrogen and
helium plasma, permeated by electromagnetic radiation, cosmic rays, neutrinos, magnetic fields and dust. The baseline
temperature of outer space, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7 kelvins (−270 °C; −455 °F).[3]

<p>Outer space does not begin at a definite altitude above Earth's surface. The Kármán line, an altitude of 100 km (62 mi)
above sea level,[8][9] is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records
keeping. Certain portions of the upper stratosphere and the mesosphere are sometimes referred to as "near space". The
framework for international space law was established by the Outer Space Treaty, which entered into force on 10 October
1967. This treaty precludes any claims of national sovereignty and permits all states to freely explore outer space.
Despite the drafting of UN resolutions for the peaceful uses of outer space, anti-satellite weapons have been tested in
Earth orbit.</p>
